Cdiscount Image Classification Challenge on kaggle.com

Some scripts which I used when competing in this challenge on kaggle.
The dataset contained ~10x more images than ILSVRC.
I tried using multiple architectures: vgg16, xception, resnext. I trained models on images resized to 80x80 because I didn't have enough computational power to train networks full-sized images.

I finished ranked top 33%.
